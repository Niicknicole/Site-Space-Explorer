"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."
The mission was a defining moment in the Space Race, demonstrating U.S. technological and engineering prowess during the Cold War. Apollo 11 returned to Earth on July 24, 1969, after a mission lasting 8 days.</li>
   
        <li><strong> <span class="highlight-blue">Voyager 1 and 2 (1977):</span></strong> The Voyager program consists of two robotic probes, Voyager 1 (launched on September 5, 1977) and Voyager 2 (launched on August 20, 1977). These spacecraft were designed to explore the outer planets of the Solar System and beyond.

Voyager 1 is currently the farthest human-made object from Earth, having entered interstellar space in 2012.

Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited all four outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).

Both Voyagers carry the famous Golden Record, a time capsule with sounds, music, and images representing humanity and Earth, intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life that might find them.</li>
     
        <li><strong> <span class="highlight-blue">Space Shuttle Program ‚Äì STS-31 (1990):</span></strong> The Space Shuttle era marked a new chapter in reusable spacecraft technology. One of the most notable missions was STS-31, launched on April 24, 1990, using the Space Shuttle Discovery. This mission successfully deployed the Hubble Space Telescope, a groundbreaking observatory that revolutionized our understanding of the universe. The shuttle carried a five-member crew and orbited Earth for nearly five days. Hubble has since captured some of the most detailed images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and other celestial phenomena, contributing immensely to modern astronomy. The shuttle program operated from 1981 to 2011, completing 135 missions.</li>
